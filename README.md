## Hi, I'm Mitch.

I am a software developer living on the Mornington Peninsula near Melbourne, Australia. I work at Microsoft on the .NET platform. For the last few years I've been working on [.NET Aspire](https://github.com/dotnet/aspire) and [ASP.NET Core](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore). Other things that I've worked at Microsoft include working on [Azure Managed Grafana](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/managed-grafana), the [Azure SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk), [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/products/devops) and 1ES.

## Some projects

- [ASP.NET Core](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore) (pretty much the best web stack around)
- [Encode Decode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mitchdenny.ecdc) (a VSCode plugin with common encoding/decoding utilities)
- [Namerer](https://github.com/mitchdenny/namerer) (a silly little utiltity to generate names for things)
